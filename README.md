# SE-Diagnostico-Covid

This is a homework of an Artificial Intelligence course where I developed a Expert System using CLIPS by defining rules.

The goal of the homework was to create rules that will help us **diagnose COVID-19** on a person.

The rules of the expert systems depends on the following categories:
* **Profession**: Could be a **Nurse**, **Secretary** or **Remote Student**. The idea is that the profession can determine the level of exposure to the COVID-19.
* **Level of exposure**: Could be **High**, **Medium** or **Low**. The idea is that the level of exposure to the virus can dramatically impact your possibility of being infected.
* **Fever**: Could be **High**, **Medium** or **Low**. The fever is a defining symptom and we divided it at: High (more than 38 degrees), Medium (Below 38 degrees), Low (No fever).
* **Cough**: Could be **Normal** or **Dry**. The dry tough is the worst case scenarios since it's one of the most defining symptoms.
* **Type of mask**: Could be **KN-95**, **Surgical** or **Cloth**. The mask a person wears tells us the level of protection they may have against the virus.
